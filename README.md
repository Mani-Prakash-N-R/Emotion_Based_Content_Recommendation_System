# Emotion_Based_Music_and_Video_Recommendation_System

Emotion-Based Music and Video Recommendation System
An AI-driven recommendation system that personalizes music and video suggestions based on real-time facial expression analysis. This project uses facial emotion recognition to dynamically tailor content recommendations, providing users with music and videos that match their current emotional state.

Project Overview
The Emotion-Based Music and Video Recommendation System is designed to detect a user's emotions using real-time facial expression analysis. Based on the identified emotion, the system recommends relevant music and video content from Spotify and YouTube, respectively. The system delivers personalized recommendations that better match the user's emotional state, providing a more dynamic experience compared to traditional recommendation systems.

Problem Solved
Traditional recommendation systems often rely on static data, such as user preferences, past behavior, or content metadata, to suggest music and videos. While these systems are effective to an extent, they often fail to account for the dynamic and subjective nature of human emotions. This project addresses that problem by using AI to detect real-time facial expressions, allowing the system to adapt and offer personalized content based on the user's emotional state at the moment.

How It Works
Real-Time Emotion Detection: The system uses OpenCV to capture the user's facial expressions through a webcam in real-time.
Emotion Classification: The captured facial expressions are processed using a pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuned on the FER 2013 dataset, to classify emotions with 82% accuracy.
Content Recommendation: Based on the detected emotion, the system integrates with the Spotify API to recommend music and the YouTube API for video suggestions, offering personalized content that aligns with the user's emotional state.
Responsive Web App: The system is deployed as a responsive web application built with Flask, providing an intuitive user interface and ensuring a fast response time of under 1.5 seconds.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: For real-time facial expression detection using a webcam.
Python: Core programming language for developing the logic and API integrations.
Flask: Web framework used to build the web application and provide an interface.
VGG16: Pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model used for emotion classification.
FER 2013 Dataset: A dataset containing labeled facial emotion data, used for training the emotion detection model.
Spotify API: Used for recommending personalized music tracks based on the detected emotion.
YouTube API: Provides personalized video recommendations based on the user's emotional state.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: Uses OpenCV to capture live facial expressions and detect emotions instantly.
Personalized Content: Music and video recommendations are tailored to the detected emotion.
Fast Response Time: The system responds within 1.5 seconds for a seamless user experience.
Web-based Interface: The system is deployed as a Flask web app, making it accessible through any browser.
Emotion Accuracy: Achieves 82% emotion detection accuracy using VGG16 trained on the FER 2013 dataset.
