# 🎶 **Emotion-Based Music and Video Recommendation System** 🎬

## 🧠 **Project Overview**
The **Emotion-Based Music and Video Recommendation System** uses **real-time facial expression analysis** to detect the user's emotions and recommends personalized **music** and **video content** based on their current emotional state. The system delivers a more dynamic and personalized experience compared to traditional recommendation engines that rely on static data like user history.

---

## 💡 **Problem Solved**
Traditional recommendation systems are based on static data like user preferences, past behavior, and metadata. While useful, they fail to adapt to the **dynamic** and **subjective** nature of human emotions. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging **AI and emotion detection**, allowing for real-time, emotion-based recommendations.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Real-Time Emotion Detection** 📸:  
   The system uses **OpenCV** to capture the user's **facial expressions** through a webcam in real-time.

2. **Emotion Classification** 🧑‍💻:  
   The captured expressions are processed using a **pre-trained VGG16 model**, fine-tuned on the **FER 2013 dataset**, to classify emotions with **82% accuracy**.

3. **Content Recommendation** 🎧🎥:  
   Based on the detected emotion, the system integrates with the **Spotify API** for music recommendations and the **YouTube API** for video suggestions, ensuring that content aligns with the user's mood.

4. **Responsive Web App** 🌐:  
   The system is deployed as a **responsive web application** built with **Flask**, offering a smooth user interface with a **response time of under 1.5 seconds**.
